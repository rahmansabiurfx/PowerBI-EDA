# Emergency Room Analytics Dashboard using Power BI

A comprehensive healthcare analytics project analyzing 9,216 emergency room visits to uncover patterns in patient demographics, department utilization, and service delivery efficiency.

# Problem Statement: Emergency Room Analytics Gap

## Challenge
The emergency department serves 9,000+ patients annually but operates without data visibility, causing inefficient resource allocation, unknown service patterns, and inability to optimize operations.

## Solution
Develop a Power BI dashboard to analyze patient demographics, department utilization, wait times, and temporal patterns for data-driven operational decisions.

## üìä Dashboard Overview

This Power BI dashboard transforms raw healthcare data into actionable insights through interactive visualizations and real-time filtering capabilities.

## üìà Demographic Analysis

### Racial Distribution Chart

This pie chart reveals the diverse patient population served by the emergency department. The visualization uses graduated blue tones to clearly distinguish between racial categories while maintaining visual harmony.

**Distribution Breakdown:**
- White: 55.5% (5,106 patients) - Majority population
- African American: 27.9% (2,570 patients)
- Asian: 21.17% (1,950 patients)
- Two or More Races: 16.89% (1,556 patients)
- Other categories each below 12%

### Age Group Composition

The age distribution analysis shows a balanced spread across adult populations with lower pediatric volumes, crucial for resource planning and specialized care provisions.

**Age Segmentation:**
- Adult (25.91%) & Senior (25.03%) - Combined 50%+ of visits
- Middle Aged: 24.8%
- Children: 12.88%
- Teen: 8.92%
- Infant: 2.39% (lowest utilization)

## üè• Department Performance Analysis

### Weekday vs Weekend Utilization

This stacked bar chart provides critical insights into department-specific utilization patterns, revealing significant weekday concentration across all departments. The visualization enables quick identification of weekend service gaps.

**Key Patterns:**
- Renal Department: 84.88% weekday (highest concentration)
- General Practice: 72.39% weekday
- Most departments: 70-75% weekday utilization
- Weekend services consistently underutilized (15-33%)
